## Allergy To Milk Or Egg

Synonyms: Dairy Allergy, Milk Protein Allergy, Casein Allergy, Whey Allergy, Egg Allergy, Egg White Allergy  


### From Healthfully

**Diet Protocol**  
- 🧀 **1 inch cube of cheese** 10 minutes prior to the food.   

**Efficiency**  
- In many cases, the cheese removes most of the reactions.  

**Comment**  
- Some newly introduced foods and for up to several years (rarely) can bring out symptoms such as gut discomfort, pain, bloating, or acne that stem from detoxification (the toxins being removed by the specific nutrients in the food cause these symptoms as they move around and damage tissue or disturb processes). The cheese neutralizes these toxins with less symptoms with its dry quality and binding properties.

### From Healthfully

**Comment**

## Cancer

Synonyms: Tumor, Malignancy, Cancerous Growth, Carcinoma, Oncology  


**Core Approach (3 Pillars)**  
1) 🚫 **Stop cooked/processed/contaminated foods** (esp. fried).  
2) 🧈 **Fill blood with raw fats** (aim **30–45% calories** from raw fat; raw dairy is soothing).  
3) 🍊 **Dissolve tumor tissues** appropriately:  
   - If **skin not broken**: use **fresh raw citrus/unripe fruits** to aid dissolution.  
   - If **skin broken** (over‑acidic, too rapid): **restrict fruit**, use **large amounts of honey**, alkaline foods; slow dissolution.

**Catalysts & Staples**  
- 🥩 **Raw meats** (fatty ground beef helpful), 🥚 raw eggs.  
- 🍊 **Unripe orange/pineapple** or **fresh raw green vegetable juices** (not with meat).  
- 🍯 **Unheated honey** with foods to supply enzymes; **raw dairy** for soothing.
- 🌰 The **Nut Formula** eaten twice weekly helps calm anxiety.

**Adjuncts**  
- 🧉 **Movement & gentle heat** (hot water bottle) increase local circulation for cleansing in tumorous areas.  
- 🍅 **Tomatoes (lycopene)** can help shrink some tumors (if not broken‑skin cases).  
- 🍋 **2oz lemon juice** with **2oz unheated honey** mixed into **4oz naturally sparkling water** helps cancer not break the skin.
- 🥛 For spine‑related cancers: full‑fat **raw milk** + extra **raw cream** + **honey** per quart.  
- 🐟 For groin area: **raw fish** + **Nut Formula** or a little **cooked potato** + fats.

**Notes**  
- ‼️ Keep diet simple and consistent during reversal phases; monitor for nausea/vomit cycles as signs of toxin dumping.

### From Healthfully
 

**Diet Protocol**  
- 🥩 **High Meat** • a cube (every week, or more) can greatly speed up results.
- 🧈 Eat **as much fat as possible** to bind to and dissolve toxicity.

**Other Tips**  
- 🛁 **Hot Baths** help the body perspire waste and can help unclog the lymphatic system to speed up recovery.  

**Comment**  
- Cancer cells hold collections of dead cells and toxins (1 cancer cell per 50 other cells). These are accumulated waste that the body couldn't discard, so it willingly generated these cancer cells to contain them. The waste is trapped inside the body mainly because of lymphatic congestion, caused by consumption of vegetable oils that harden into plastic over years, or because of a shutdown of the liver. Often, cancer can result from a shutdown of the liver. Cancer cells contain a solvent that can break down all the waste around it, not doing it right away because it would liberate too much toxicity. A "malignant" tumor can dissolve more easily than a "benign" tumor, as it is linked and communicating more with the rest of the body.  

**Comment**  
- The fastest results can occur with high meat, even in a few days given enough high meat.  
Universities have expensive cancer treatment programs using *E. coli* and salmonella injections; you can just eat them.

### From Healthfully

- 👉🏻 Body fat, just like dietary fat, is used to embed and neutralize toxins. It eventually ends up saturated with them. Therefore, it is healthy to lose fat every few months or years, just like changing oil in a car.  

**Diet Protocol to lose fat**  
- 🥚🥩 One **raw egg** or a small amount of **lean meat** (every few hours, less than 5h to avoid autophagy).
- 🥬 Celery Juice • 1 cup (alternated with the egg).

**Efficiency**

**Comment**  
- ‼️ If you have been on the diet for many years with extra weight, and get a flu, it is because the body is finally trying to force get rid of it. It is a good time to go on this weight loss program.  
- 👉🏻 Protein requires fat to digest in a certain ratio and will pull off stored fats if they are not available through diet. Can be merged with the previous egg–juice protocol.  

**Diet Protocol**  
- 🍨 Ice Cream • as much as wanted (Just an example, could be any Primal Diet food).  

**Efficiency**  
- ⏱️ A few days or weeks.

**Comment**  
- 🤔 That is the example of one of Aajonus' clients who was an obese woman addicted to ice cream. Eating it, but raw, every day, she kept dropping pounds, until one day the strong cravings suddenly subsided. That is because the new clean fats let the body drop off old toxic fats immediately.
