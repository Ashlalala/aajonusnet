## Allergy To Milk Or Egg

Synonyms: Dairy Allergy, Milk Protein Allergy, Casein Allergy, Whey Allergy, Egg Allergy, Egg White Allergy  


### From Healthfully

**Diet Protocol**  
🧀 Cheese • 1 inch cube (no less than 10 min before the food giving reaction)  

**Efficiency**  
In many cases, the cheese removes most of the reactions.  

**Comment**  
Some newly introduced foods and for up to several years (rarely) can bring out symptoms such as gut discomfort, pain, bloating, or acne that stem from detoxification (the toxins being removed by the specific nutrients in the food cause these symptoms as they move around and damage tissue or disturb processes). The cheese neutralizes these toxins with less symptoms with its dry quality and binding properties.

### Hair Loss

When the brain is detoxifying, toxins can leave through the scalp. The more caustic they are, the more they can harm the follicles on their way out, and dry the hair by stripping fats from it to bind with. In men, more testosterone can be produced, and used to bind to toxins — as hormones contain cholesterol, a fat — and create more detoxification through this pathway.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🧈 Fat  
Fat, in great amount, is essential to cleanse, strengthen, and build all tissue.  

🥩 Meat • 1kg (daily)  
Proteins, especially the mature kind meat possesses, help generate new tissue.  

👑 Royal Jelly • 1 drop (with meat)  
Contains growth hormones. Eaten with meat, doubles the protein usage.  

🥣 Moisturizing-Lubrication Formula • one–two servings (twice daily)  
This recipe can shuttle fats to outer areas which are generally underfed, including the scalp and hair.

2) 🧈 **Fill blood with raw fats** (aim **30–45% calories** from raw fat; raw dairy is soothing).  
3) 🍊 **Dissolve tumor tissues** appropriately:  
   - If **skin not broken**: use **fresh raw citrus/unripe fruits** to aid dissolution.  
   - If **skin broken** (over‑acidic, too rapid): **restrict fruit**, use **larger honey**, alkaline foods; slow dissolution.

**Catalysts & Staples**  
- 🥩 **Raw meats** (fatty ground beef helpful), 🥚 raw eggs.  
- 🍊 **Unripe orange/pineapple** or **fresh raw green vegetable juices** (not with meat).  
- 🍯 **Unheated honey** with foods to supply enzymes; **raw dairy** for soothing.

**Relevant topic**  
Cancer  


### Cancer

Cancer cells hold collections of dead cells and toxins (1 cancer cell per 50 other cells). These are accumulated waste that the body couldn't discard, so it willingly generated these cancer cells to contain them. The waste is trapped inside the body mainly because of lymphatic congestion, caused by consumption of vegetable oils that harden into plastic over years, or because of a shutdown of the liver. Often, cancer can result from a shutdown of the liver. Cancer cells contain a solvent that can break down all the waste around it, not doing it right away because it would liberate too much toxicity. A "malignant" tumor can dissolve more easily than a "benign" tumor, as it is linked and communicating more with the rest of the body.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🥩 High Meat • a cube (every week, or more)  

**Efficiency**  
The fastest results can occur with high meat, even in a few days given enough high meat.  

**Comment**  
Universities have expensive cancer treatment programs using *E. coli* and salmonella injections; you can just eat them.  

**Bath Protocol**  
🛁 Baths  

**Comment**  
Baths help perspire waste and when prolonged, unclog the lymphatic system which can again clean the body of the waste that the cancer is holding off.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🧈 Fat • 80% of the diet (as often as possible)  

**Comment**  
Fats are the main component of solvents the body creates to dissolve waste and bind to toxicity.  

**Relevant topic**  
Improved Digestion  

**Comment**  
Often, a cancer can result from a shutdown of the liver, which can't metabolize enough fats anymore. There are various strategies to be able to digest more fats.

### Constipation

**Diet Protocol**  
🧈 Fat  

**Diet Protocol**  
🥩 High Meat  

**Comment**  
Constipation is from the nervous system being underfed and *E. coli* in the colon holding onto matter; high meat feeds that directly.  

**Relevant topic**  
Difficulty to gain fat  

**Comment**  
Having extra fats for a while ensures the nervous system is fed on a daily basis.  


### Suppository

Feeds the nervous system directly. The *E. coli,* present in the colon, are responsible for breaking down food matter to the smallest particles and feeding the nervous system.  

**Topical Care Protocol**  
Apply these items on the concerned site:  
🧈 Butter • 3 tablespoons  
🥛 Cream • 3 tablespoons  
🥥 Coconut Cream • 3 tablespoons  
🍯 Honey • 1/3 teaspoon  
To induce a little bit of detoxification.  

**Comment**  
Warm to room temperature all ingredients. Blenderize together and inject them, using a device that can reach deep enough (can use a douching device). Lay with your hips raised, and "belly dance" for 4 minutes. Then immediately lay on your right side, raise your left leg, and "belly dance" for 4 more minutes. That ensures the fat reaches the colon. Don't stand up before many hours pass or it will fall back down. It is good to do it before sleeping.

### Cheese Trains

Dry foods digest less. When raw, and unsalted, their nutrients retain their bounds. Cheese, in particular, is very dense in minerals and fats, and will almost not digest at all, the more dry it gets. Instead, it will strongly attract fixed and circulating toxins from gums, gut, blood, lymph and neurological fluids, embed them and exit with them through the bowels.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🧀 Cheese • 1 inch cube (regularly throughout the day)  

**Efficiency**  
Speeds up detoxification by multiples, attenuates symptoms almost immediately, improves digestion greatly.  

**Comment**  
Cheese cubes should be regularly consumed throughout the day. Could be 2h, 1h, 15min. Or when having a strong craving for them is an indication that toxin dumping is taking place and its frequency of consumption should be increased immediately. No less than 10min before meals or 40min slots as well, to absorb toxins in the gut and have a good digestive environment for the food passing through.  


### House Mold

House molds or any mold grown on unnatural substances, which includes cooked foods, is toxic, because it is in a sort of mutated state, and will behave abnormally, as well as breathing out toxins from the toxic surfaces it has grown from.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🍋‍🟩 Lime Juice • around 8 tablespoons (the same day of ingestion of spores)  

🍋‍🟩 Lime Juice • 2 tablespoons (every other day)  

**Comment**  
Lime juice has an antibiotic effect, which in this case can be taken advantage of.

**Diet Protocol**  
💧 Water  

**Comment**  
Water indirectly can spare nutrients, by its inorganic minerals serving to bind to toxins. However, too much will dilute blood and lead to more loss of nutrients through urination (diluted water should be avoided for this reason).  


### Strong Milk Cravings

Cravings to drink several liters of milk daily, with a constant feeling of thirst.

### From Healthfully

Body fat, just like dietary fat, is used to embed and neutralize toxins. It eventually ends up saturated with them. Therefore, it is healthy to lose fat every few months or years, just like changing oil in a car.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🥚 Egg • 1 (every few hours, less than 5h to avoid autophagy)  
A raw egg alone digests effortlessly, thus avoiding ending up stored as fat, and strips off old, stubborn fats efficiently.  

🥬 Celery Juice • 1 cup (alternated with the egg)  
Vegetable juice provides heme-iron that is necessary with a heavy intake of raw eggs.  

**Efficiency**  
This can be a very fast way to lose fat. If reaching a plateau, it may be better to stop. Avoid prolonging this program beyond a few weeks.  

**Comment**  
If you have been on the diet for many years with extra weight, and get a flu, it is because the body is finally trying to force get rid of it. It is a good time to go on this weight loss program.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🥩 Meat • any desired amount (every few hours, less than 5h to avoid autophagy)  
The meat must be lean.  

**Efficiency**  
A few days or weeks  

**Comment**  
Protein requires fat to digest in a certain ratio and will pull off stored fats if they are not available through diet. Can be merged with the previous egg–juice protocol.  

**Diet Protocol**  
🍨 Ice Cream • as much as wanted  
Just an example. Could be any item craved, but raw and within Primal Diet™'s confines.  

**Efficiency**  
A few days or weeks  

**Comment**  
That is the example of one of Aajonus' clients who was an obese woman addicted to ice cream. Eating it, but raw, every day, she kept dropping pounds, until one day the strong cravings suddenly subsided. That is because the new clean fats let the body drop off old toxic fats immediately.
